# Phase 4 — Write the CHANGELOG entry

Goal: append (or create) `CHANGELOG.md` with a section for the new version that
faithfully describes what shipped, with commit links.

Load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/changelog-template.md` now if you haven't already —
it has the section template, bucket rules, link format, and style notes.

## Step 4.1 — Write the section

Append a new section above any prior version sections. The section template includes:

- `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` header
- A one-paragraph framing
- `### Added` / `### Fixed` / `### Changed` / `### Removed` buckets as needed
- Optional `### Breaking Changes` first if the bump is major
- The `[X.Y.Z]: https://...` reference link at the bottom of the file

For each chosen commit in `$SUBSET`:

1. Map its conventional prefix to a bucket:
   - `feat:` → Added
   - `fix:` / `perf:` → Fixed
   - `refactor:` / config-only changes the user notices → Changed
   - deletions of public surface → Removed
2. Read the diff if the subject is terse — the bullet should explain user-visible impact,
   not summarize the commit message verbatim.
3. Resolve the author handle for attribution (see `changelog-template.md` → Attribution).
   When the commit subject carries a squashed PR number `(#NN)`:

   ```bash
   gh pr view <NN> --repo "$(git remote get-url origin)" --json author --jq '.author.login'
   ```

   Otherwise fall back to the commit's GitHub author:

   ```bash
   gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<sha>" --jq '.author.login'
   ```

   If the login is **not** `delexw` (the maintainer), the bullet must credit them; if it
   **is** `delexw`, add no handle.

4. End the bullet with a commit link, plus the handle when the author isn't the
   maintainer:
   - external author: ``([`<sha7>`](https://github.com/PixelPaw-Labs/codex-trace/commit/<sha>), @contributor)``
   - maintainer (`delexw`): ``([`<sha7>`](https://github.com/PixelPaw-Labs/codex-trace/commit/<sha>))``

Always skip `chore:` / `docs:` / `test:` / `ci:` — they clutter user-facing CHANGELOGs.
The skill is non-interactive.

## Step 4.2 — Format

```bash
npx oxfmt CHANGELOG.md
```

This is required — `npm run fmt:check` in Phase 5 will fail otherwise.

## Step 4.3 — Sanity check

Read the final CHANGELOG entry top-to-bottom as if you were a user encountering it on
the release page. Look for:

- Vague bullets ("fix issue", "improve performance") — rewrite with the visible
  symptom.
- Missing commit links — every bullet needs one.
- Wrong bucket — features under Fixed, bug fixes under Added, etc.
- Repetitive openers — vary sentence structure.

Proceed to Phase 5.
